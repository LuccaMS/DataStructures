That repository was created to maintain some codes that i wrote while i was doing the course of data structres, we were using Google Test with C++ to implement some codes of data structures,
such as linked lists, binary search tree, AVL tree, hash table and Dijkstra's algorithm.


To be able to run the tests you must install google test on your PC and then to compile you will need to use these arguments

# g++ main.cpp -o -g -lgtest -std=c++17 



Note: some of the codes have more than one CPP file, so you may have to change the argument of only main.cpp to include the others files, most of then will compile just with main.cpp
